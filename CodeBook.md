This lists the columns and values (if relevant) for the extracted data from the 'Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset'.  The dataset contains the means and standard devations from a set of observations from an accelerometer and gyroscope.

SubjectID - The ID of the subject to which the observation pertains to
Activity - This columns describes the activity for the measurement WALKING,WALKING_UPSTAIRS,WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS,SITTING,STANDING,LAYING
Dataset - This lists whether or not the data is 'TEST' or 'TRAINING' data
